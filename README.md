# Veguma Salary app

I created this app for calculating my salary. Its connected to my Google spreadsheet, where it stores all data. <img src="[https://i.imgur.com/ZWnhY9T.png](https://github.com/OolaaPleur/salary_app/assets/29483340/ed8b5333-1071-4b88-8824-f970f96061af)" width=50% height=50%>
On main screen user type data, after clicking plus button data goes to Google spreadsheet document. Also app has three more screens with different charts![Screenshot_20230606_153907](https://github.com/OolaaPleur/salary_app/assets/29483340/2cb14d7f-e4cb-4467-a9ac-de7b3c4cac58)
